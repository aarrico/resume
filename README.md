## SUMMARY

Innovative engineering leader with over nine years of experience building and managing high-performing teams to deliver scalable, customer-focused software solutions. Proven success architecting and developing robust applications, including a messaging service built with Node, React, and AWS handling over 350,000 daily messages and the complete overhaul of a flagship product, migrating over 20,000 users in under a year. Adept at implementing emerging technologies and agile methodologies, demonstrated by establishing a collaborative engineering team that increased ticket completion rates by 65%. I foster a collaborative and inclusive management style, driving teams to engage with stakeholders and customers to build exceptional products. Eager to bring this passion for connection and innovation to my next role, developing future-state roadmaps and achieving key performance indicators.

## AREAS OF EXPERTISE

API Development, Project Management, Process Improvement, Cloud Technologies, Agile Methodologies, Software Architecture, Testing & Optimization, Problem Solving and Troubleshooting, Testing and Quality Assurance

## ACCOMPLISHMENTS

*   Led a cross-functional team of 5 (engineers, QA, and product) while contributing as an individual developer to rebuild a communication platform for hourly workers and their managers using `Node.JS`/`React.JS`, migrating 20,000 users to the new platform in under a year from a `Java` (`Spring Boot`) backend and no-code frontend.
*   Architected and developed the backend for a high-volume messaging service using `Twilio` and `AWS` (`Lambdas`, `SQS`) that processed over 350,000 outbound and 12,000 inbound messages daily, achieving near real-time interactions between hourly workers and managers.
*   Developed and implemented a `Python` scripting API within a `Java` desktop application, enabling customers to automate workflows and significantly reducing user in-app time by a factor of 30.
*   Founded the company's first engineering team, establishing standard operating procedures based on Agile principles, resulting in a 65% increase in ticket completion rates.
*   Rapidly developed and deployed a customer portal using `Python`/`Flask` and `Google Cloud Platform` within seven days, enabling client services teams to conduct virtual software training at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.

## EXPERIENCE

**HOURWORK, INC.** | MAY 2022 - NOV 2023
**Engineering Manager**

*   Spearheaded the complete overhaul of the flagship product from conception to execution, managing a team of three engineers and successfully transitioning over 20,000 users to the new platform within 11 months.
*   Oversaw the re-engineering of the product's data models, reducing average database query times by a factor of 200 and enabling the development of previously unfeasible features due to computational complexity.
*   Revolutionized the development workflow by implementing robust engineering processes, enabling the seamless rollout of weekly feature releases post-migration, a significant improvement from the previous sporadic release cycles that spanned months.
*   Architected a clean and scalable system architecture complemented by comprehensive logging mechanisms, facilitating the swift identification and resolution of critical issues within a 24-hour timeframe.
*   Achieved a 85% reduction in customer-reported bugs within two months post-transition to the new system.
*   Provided regular performance reviews and mentored team members, fostering a culture of continuous learning and growth.

**BLUEMARK** | JUN 2021 - APR 2022
**Lead Software Engineer**, Valencia, CA

*   Developed a `RESTful API` for an e-commerce platform within an existing customer portal, using `Python`/`Flask` and `PostgreSQL` on `AWS` `EC2`. Supported front-end engineers using `React` and documented API specifications using `OpenAPI`.
*   Collaborated with cross-functional teams to ensure alignment and effective communication throughout the rebuild process allowing features to be shipped weekly.
*   Conducted code reviews with other team members to ensure the code written worked as intended and followed style guidelines.
*   Reduced the number of bugs found in QA and staging environments by 70% by writing unit tests for the backend utilizing `pytest` and `Jest` for the front end.
*   Utilized `SQLAlchemy` `ORM` to streamline Postgres database setup and reduce query overhead.

**OPTRICITY CORP.** | JAN 2019 - JUN 2021
**Director of Technology**

*   Led the daily operations and personnel of the Development Team, growing the team from one to four members, including two Junior Developers and a Senior Developer. Oversaw the creation of all hiring, onboarding, and training processes.
*   Reduced load times for large projects by 70% by re-architecting the flagship product's project loading process from `XML` files.
*   Established and founded Agile framework, based on Extreme Programming for all future product development, and transitioned self-hosted bug & issue tracker to `GitLab`, off-loading admin time and allowing engineers to focus on writing high-quality code.
*   Integrated a `Python` scripting API within the `Java` product, enabling the addition of a regression testing step to the `CI/CD` pipeline and resulting in a 60% reduction in customer-reported bugs.
*   Created and implemented a serverless-based portal system that allowed the Industrial Engineering and Client Solution teams the ability to conduct virtual training and other key client-business functions remotely via `Google Cloud App Engine` and `Firebase` `NoSQL` Database when in-person training was temporarily not possible.

**Senior Software Engineer** | JAN 2018 - JAN 2019

*   Developed a quality control scanner authored in `Python`/`Flask` and `React` to review client data files for any errors, allowing the `CSV` file to be securely uploaded and get immediate feedback, before uploading the files to their project reducing the client success team's help desk tickets by 20%.
*   Developed a web services API for the `Java` flagship product, enabling customers to connect their Warehouse Management System directly to the program and eliminating manual file uploads. Provided supporting documentation for client implementation and coordinated testing with a third-party partner.
